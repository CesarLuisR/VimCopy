# VimoText (vimc)

A simple, terminal-based text editor inspired by Vim.

## üöÄ How to Run

There are **two** ways to get started. In either case, you need **g++** installed on your machine.

1. **Using the installer**  
   - Run the `install.bat` script (located one level above `VimoText\`) from a Windows CMD:  
     ```bat
     install.bat
     ```  
   - Close and reopen your terminal.  
   - You can now launch the editor from **any** folder by typing:  
     ```
     vimc
     ```

2. **Manual compilation**  
   - Open a terminal (or CMD) and navigate into the `VimoText` directory.  
   - Compile all `.cpp` files into an executable:  
     ```bash
     g++ *.cpp -o vimc.exe
     ```  
   - Run it directly from that folder:  
     ```bash
     ./vimc.exe
     ```

## üìñ What Is It & What It Does

**VimoText** (`vimc`) is a lightweight, command-mode text editor for the Windows console, heavily inspired by Vim. It supports:

- **Normal mode**, for navigation and commands  
- **Insert mode**, for typing new text  
- **Visual mode**, for selecting blocks of text  

It keeps an undo/redo history and lets you save and load files, all without leaving your terminal.

## üéØ Takeaways & Lessons Learned

During this project I **did not** initially apply several best practices, and by missing them I learned their true importance. Going forward, I will always incorporate:

- **Clean Architecture (MVC):**  
  I skipped designing a clear separation of Model, View, and Controller at the start, which made the code harder to maintain. Now I understand how crucial architectures like MVC are for the scalability of large projects.
  
- **Design & Documentation First:**  
  I jumped straight into coding without a high-level system design or documentation. I learned that planning and writing down architecture decisions up front saves time and avoids confusion later.

- **Design Patterns:**  
  I implemented a basic Command pattern for undo/redo, but omitted other useful patterns (Observer, Factory, etc.). Not using them taught me their value for organizing complex logic.

- **Automated Builds & Installs:**  
  I relied on manual scripts rather than a proper build system. Failing to use tools like CMake or containers showed me the importance of automating compilation and installation across different environments.

By realizing what I missed, these lessons will now be integral to every future project.
