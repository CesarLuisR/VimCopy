# VimoText (vimc)

A simple, terminal-based text editor inspired by Vim.

## üöÄ How to Run

There are **two** ways to get started. In either case, you need **g++** installed on your machine.

1. **Using the installer**  
   - Run the `install.bat` script (located one level above `VimoText\`) from a Windows CMD:  
     ```bat
     install.bat
     ```  
   - Close and reopen your terminal.  
   - You can now launch the editor from **any** folder by typing:  
     ```
     vimc
     ```

2. **Manual compilation**  
   - Open a terminal (or CMD) and navigate into the `VimoText` directory.  
   - Compile all `.cpp` files into an executable:  
     ```bash
     g++ *.cpp -o vimc.exe
     ```  
   - Run it directly from that folder:  
     ```bash
     ./vimc.exe
     ```

## üìñ What Is It & What It Does

**VimoText** (`vimc`) is a lightweight, command-mode text editor for the Windows console, heavily inspired by Vim. It supports:

- **Normal mode**, for navigation and commands  
- **Insert mode**, for typing new text  
- **Visual mode**, for selecting blocks of text  

It keeps an undo/redo history and lets you save and load files, all without leaving your terminal.

## üìú A Bit of History

My first text editor was built in Node.js. It was extremely basic, only capable of opening files and appending text to the end. Driven by curiosity about how editors navigate and modify text, I reimplemented the idea in C. That initial C version never saw completion: I got stuck on undo/redo modules, the Piece Table was riddled with bugs, and rendering was clunky. Undeterred, I tried again in C. The Piece Table became more stable, undo/redo worked sporadically, and rendering improved slightly. Finally, this latest incarnation in C++ brought everything together, performance is solid and features behave reliably, even if the code could be cleaner. What will I tackle next time, and what leap will I make?  

## üéØ Takeaways & Lessons Learned

During this project I **did not** initially apply several best practices, and by missing them I learned their true importance. Going forward, I will always incorporate:

- **Clean Architecture (MVC):**  
  I skipped designing a clear separation of Model, View, and Controller at the start, which made the code harder to maintain. Now I understand how crucial architectures like MVC are for the scalability of large projects.
  
- **Design & Documentation First:**  
  I jumped straight into coding without a high-level system design or documentation. I learned that planning and writing down architecture decisions up front saves time and avoids confusion later.

- **Design Patterns:**  
  I implemented a basic Command pattern for undo/redo, but omitted other useful patterns (Observer, Factory, etc.). Not using them taught me their value for organizing complex logic.

- **Automated Builds & Installs:**  
  I relied on manual scripts rather than a proper build system. Failing to use tools like CMake or containers showed me the importance of automating compilation and installation across different environments.

- **Testing Coverage:**  
  I wrote unit tests for the Piece Table, but due to a less modular architecture I couldn‚Äôt adequately test command execution logic. This taught me to structure code for full testability, not just isolated components.

- **Data Structure Design:**  
  While I created a very efficient Piece Table for the main buffer, I didn‚Äôt spend enough time optimizing the data structure for managing selected text. Next time, I‚Äôll give equal attention to all core data structures.


By realizing what I missed, these lessons will now be integral to every future project.
